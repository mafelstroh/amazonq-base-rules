## Advanced Code Generation Rules
### When generating complex applications:
1. Implement proper error boundaries with fallback UIs
2. Add comprehensive loading states with skeleton screens
3. Include proper TypeScript generics and utility types
4. Implement custom hooks for complex logic
5. Add comprehensive testing setup with 80%+ coverage
6. Include Storybook for component documentation
7. Implement proper SEO with meta tags and structured data
8. Add analytics integration points
9. Include proper environment configuration
10. Implement proper logging and monitoring hooks

### Testing Excellence (AAA Pattern)
- **Arrange**: Set up test data, mocks, and initial state
- **Act**: Execute the function or user interaction being tested
- **Assert**: Verify the expected outcome with clear assertions
- Test component rendering, user interactions, and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, services, utilities)
- Test accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation
- Include happy path, error scenarios, and loading states
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

### Architecture Decisions

- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement proper error handling strategies
- Use proper TypeScript strict mode configurations
- Implement proper code splitting strategies
